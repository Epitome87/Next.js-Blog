2. Working at an agency
   - A company that has a bunch of designers and developers -- they find the clients for you!
3. Working in-house
   - Working for an actual company / product

## Section 03 - Sketching

### Introduction to Sketching

Sketching is a 2-step process:

1. Idea Generation
   - Generate as many ideas as we can -- quickly!
   - Decide on which is the most efficient for the task
2. Adding Detail / Refinement
   - Step by step, work on refining those sketches and then adding more detail
   - OK to kill some of your ideas here -- that's the point!

You want to go from _ideas_ to _components_:

Ideas

- Initial sketches with lower level of details, lack of color, basic

Wireframes

- Refining details of promising initial sketches
- Maybe not all the details still, but a lot of the _key_ details
- Starting to think a little more of interaction

Components

- Pull out certain elements that are really needed
- Buttons, inputs, etc

### The Sketching Process

1. Be prepared!
   - Gather your tools, papers, etc
   - Think about your goals -- what are you trying to achieve / solve for?
   - Who is your audience?
   - Timebox yourself! Timebox everything!
2. Just go!
   - Draw a frame for your device (phone, desktop)
   - Start with more simple and redundant elements (footer, header, etc)
   - Move onto some more detailed interactions (still only need to draw basic shapes)
   - Annotate your sketches and keep them safe
   - Keep going! Find the sketches you like and keep building alternatives from that, keep going with the ones you think have potential
   - Share your sketches. Listen to comments and feedback
3. Refinement
   - Add titles to your sketches. Help you understand which screens are relevant
   - Add annotations...again. Help clarify things that are too hard to draw
   - Use numbers. Number your sketches, helps others make sense where something fits in, easier to give feedback ("I like screen #3!")
   - Use arrows. They help indicate a transition / flow.
   - Add gestures if you want (Tap, Double Tap, Drag, Flick, Pinch, SPread, Press, Press + Tap)

### Sketching User Flows

1. What am I thinking of sketching?
   - Large journey, small interaction?
2. Starting point?
   - Middle of journey? Beginning? The most difficult / riskiest parts?
3. Decide your next steps.
   - Which way will this step lead our users? Where do I want them to go? What do they need to do to get there? What options do they have? What happens if they close the app at this point -- where will they resume?

Create a customer jounery, from point A to B. Identify pain points -- when are they feeling happy through this journey, or sad. Where can we improve? Where can we branch out and focus on different types of flows?
